This program generates a basic dungeon model according to the assignment 1.08 specifications. Our program generates monsters from the monster_descriptions in gen_monster, in npc.cpp.
We also changed the io_display method to display color as well as objects. Our gen_monsters method also generates objects from our object class in descriptions.h.
