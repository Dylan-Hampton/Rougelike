This program generates a basic dungeon model according to the assignment 1.05 specifications.
Our solution allows the game to update in a smooth fashion using the ncurses library. It now also implements a method for the
player to mover based off of the specification sheet, this includes moving up and down the stairs which  generates a new dungeon.
Upon clicking the 'm' key, a list of monsters as well as their relative positions to the player is displayed, this can be
scrolled through and will pause the game, the list can be left after pressing the 'escape' key. 'space', '5', and '.' will move
the game along without moving the PC. Finally, the 'Q' key will quit the game entirely.
