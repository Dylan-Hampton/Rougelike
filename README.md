This program generates a basic dungeon model according to the assignment 1.09 specifications. We created methods in pc.cpp, to remove, expunge, grab, wear, drop items. We also limited the items in a player's inventory to be only one of each type, aside from rings where you can wear 2 of them. Updated to combat to make the only win condition to kill a monster with the boss tag, and combat is now damage based. every attack is not an instant kill anymore, instead it rolls the damage dice, and subtracts that from the defender's health. We made it so that you can look at item and monster descriptions. also you can list all of the items and equipment on the player.
