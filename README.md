This program generates a basic dungeon model according to the assignment 1.03 specifications.
Our solution creates distance maps in dungeon.c and are populated in path_finding.c for soon to be implemented tunneling
and non-tunneling monsters using Dijkstra's Algorithm with respect to the player character.
Our implementation of Dijkstra's uses a modified version of Sheaffer's implementation of the Dijkstra corridor.
