This program generates a basic dungeon model according to the assignment 1.01 specifications.

Our solution creates 6 rooms of a random height and width between 3-6 and 4-7 respectively.
Next the program generates an upper and lower staircase and then generates paths to connect
all the rooms together using corridors.
