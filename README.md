This program generates a basic dungeon model according to the assignment 1.02 specifications.

Our solution creates 6 rooms of a random height and width between 3-6 and 4-7 respectively.
Next the program generates an upper and lower staircase and then generates paths to connect
all the rooms together using corridors.

We also have added the funtionality to save and load dungeons that have been previously created from binary files.
